## üì¶ Installation

Install PhilApprovalFlow via NuGet Package Manager:

```bash
Install-Package PhilApprovalFlow -Version 1.3.0
```

Or via .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package PhilApprovalFlow --version 1.3.0
```

## üî• Quick Start

```csharp
// 1. Create an entity that implements IApprovalFlow
public class Invoice : IApprovalFlow<InvoiceTransition>
{
    public ICollection<InvoiceTransition> Transitions { get; set; }
    public Guid InvoiceId { get; set; }
    
    public object GetID() => InvoiceId;
    public string GetShortDescription() => $"Invoice #{InvoiceId}";
    public string GetLongDescription() => $"Invoice for {Amount:C} - {Description}";
}

// 2. Create your transition type
public class InvoiceTransition : PAFTransition, IPAFTransition { }

// 3. Use the fluent API
var invoice = new Invoice();
var workflow = invoice.GetApprovalFlow();

// Request approval from a manager
workflow.SetUserName("employee@company.com")
        .RequestApproval("manager@company.com", "Manager", "Please approve this invoice");

// Manager approves the request
workflow.SetUserName("manager@company.com")
        .Approve("Approved - looks good!");

// Check if fully approved
bool isApproved = invoice.Transitions.IsApproved();
```
